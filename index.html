					<h3>About Padmasambhava</h3>
					<p>Padmasambhava or Padmakara means ‘Lotus-born’, which refers to Guru Rinpoche's birth from a lotus in the land of Oddiyana. Guru Rinpoche, the ‘Precious Master’, is the founder of Tibetan Buddhism and the Buddha of our time. Whereas Buddha is known primarily for having taught the teachings of the sutra vehicle, Padmasambhava came into this world, and to Tibet in particular, in order to teach the tantras. While Buddha Shakyamuni exemplifies the buddha principle, the most important element in the sutrayana path, Padmasambhava personifies the guru principle, the heart of Vajrayana Buddhism, and he is therefore known as the ‘second Buddha’.</p>

							<h3>Guru Tsokyé Dorje,'Lake-born Vajra'(birth)</h3>
							<div>
								<p>One of the Eight Manifestations of Guru Rinpoche. One of the distinctive features of this peaceful form of Guru Rinpoche is that he is represented holding a vajra at his heart.</p>
								<p>From the book <em>A Great Treasure of Blessings</em>, pages 25–26:</p>
								<p>In the north-western part of the land of Oddiyana, on an island in the lake of Dhanakosha, the blessings of all the buddhas took shape in the form of a multi-coloured lotus flower. Moved with compassion at the suffering of sentient beings, the Buddha Amitabha sent out from his heart a golden vajra, marked with the syllable HRIH, which descended into the lotus blossom. It transformed into an exquisitely beautiful eight-year old child.</p>
								<p>As Guru Rinpoche was born within the lotus flower upon the waters of the lake, the dakinis called out to him from their hearts, and their call spontaneously became the Vajra Guru mantra. So this mantra is his heart mantra, his life core, his heart essence, and to recite it is to invoke his very being. He is known as Tsokye Dorje, 'Lake-born Vajra'.</p>

						<h3>Guru Shakya Sengé,'Lion of the Shakyas'(ordination)</h3>
						<p>
							<p>One of the Eight Manifestations of Guru Rinpoche. In this form, he is depicted as a buddha in monastic robes, holding an alms bowl in his left hand and a vajra in his right hand.</p>
							<p>From the book <em> A Great Treasure of Blessings</em>, pages 27–28:</p>
							<p>At 'the Vajra Seat' in Bodhgaya, Guru Rinpoche displayed miracles, acknowledging he was a self-manifested buddha. Although he was a fully enlightened buddha, he appeared as a nirmanakaya manifestation to tame and teach beings in this age, and so for their benefit he acted as if receiving teachings, accomplishing the practice and passing through the various stages of spiritual realization, one by one. Some accounts tell how in Vajrasana, he was ordained by the Buddha's closest disciple, Ananda. Others say he took ordination from Prabhahasti in Zahor and was given the name Shakya Sengé, 'Lion of the Shakyas'.</p>

						<h3>Guru Padmasambhava, ‘Lotus-born’(establishing Buddhism in Tibet)</h3>
						<p>
							Guru Padmasambhava (Skt.; Tib. གུ་རུ་པདྨ་འབྱུང་གནས་, Wyl. gu ru pad+ma 'byung gnas, Eng. ‘Lotus-born’) is actually the specific name of one of the Eight Manifestations of Guru Rinpoche. However, the name Padmasambhava now commonly refers to all the iconographical aspects of Guru Rinpoche. As one of the Eight Manifestations, Guru Padmasambhava is most often depicted as a pandita wearing monks robes, holding a kapala in his right hand and performing the vitarka mudra with his left hand.
